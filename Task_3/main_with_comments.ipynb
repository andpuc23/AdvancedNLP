    "### The Approach\n",
    "The argument identification and classification experiment will be carried out with two different approaches both employing the BERT model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the predicate identification is a given in this experiment, the main challenge of this task is to find a solution for\n",
    "representing the relation between each sentence and the predicate under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original PropBank dataset, sentences can host any number of predicates (including none) thus, when a sentence has two or more predicates, the rest of its tokens are bound to express different arguments in relation to each predicate. Consequently, in order for the model to be able to correctly predict and assign argument labels for a sentence, we need to first establish - each time - the predicate under consideration. For example, in the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"John cooked dinner and served dessert to his guests.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "for both predicates \"cooked\" and \"served\", the subject (ARG0) is \"John\", but the object (ARG1) is \"dinner\" for \"cooked\" and \"dessert\" for \"served\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our focus lies in determining an effective representation for the model input allowing for the model to classify the arguments within a sentence relative to a specific predicate. The first step is reduplicating each sentence based on the number of its predicates so each sentence is presented in the dataset each time in relation to a unique predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the process involves structuring the input data in a manner that enables the model to understand the relationships between tokens and the possible argument labels within the context of a specific predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To experiment on the basis of the input representation, we will build both a baseline and an advanced model. In both cases the relation of each sentence and a specific predicate will be encoded into the model's input. "

    "#### The Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "The function of the baseline model is to offer a straightforward approach to the task, serving as a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of the more advanced model. As such, the baseline will be employing a more simplistic approach to input representation inspired by Shi and Lin (2019):\n",
    "\n",
    "[CLS] Barack Obama went to Paris [SEP] went [SEP] ,\n",
    "\n",
    "in which the predicate information - each time signaling the predicate in question - only consists of the predicate token itself. At the same time, the [CLS] token typically represents the aggregate understanding of the entire sentence, serving as a sentence-level representation and capturing the contextual information necessary for semantic role labeling.\n",
    "The [SEP] token demarcates the boundaries between different segments of the input. In this representation, it separates the sentence from the predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach entails limitations. The mosts obvious one would be the case in which a sentence contains the same predicate twice. In this case only using the predicate itself as the predicate indicator would not allow the model to distinguish between the two different predicates. "

    "The overall results of the baseline model evidently show its limitations also on the practical level. Although the model presents a high micro-averaged F1-score of 0.95, indicating that the model performs relatively well across all classes - when considering each prediction equally - this is quickly controverted by its very low macro average scores. Macro-average calculates the metric independently for each class and then takes the average across all classes, treating each class equally regardless of its size or frequency. A quick inspection of individual classes makes it clear that the high aggragated micro scores are mostly the product of the a few higly represented classes, including both the predicate class and the placeholder label. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a considerable variation in precision, recall, and F1-score across labels as some classes have high precision and recall, while others have much lower scores including 0. The model seems to be performing well on frequent and well represented labels while the very infrequent ones do not get at all predicted. Classes like 'ARGM-NEG' (Negative Modifier) and 'ARGM-MOD' (Modal Modifier) have a big range in performance, with F1-scores ranging from 0.33 to 0.91, although they are not the most represented ones. On the other hand, 'ARG1' and 'ARG0' are more frequent and show promising but clearly lower results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach provides a straightforward starting point, it presents notable limitations. One critical drawback is the model's inability to grasp contextual nuances, limiting its capacity to capture the intricate relationships between predicates and their arguments accurately. Due to the lack of contextual understanding, the model may struggle to disambiguate between different senses of predicates and may misclassify arguments. Moreover, relying on simplistic representations limits the model's generalization capabilities across diverse texts and domains, impacting its performance on unseen data. This can also be proven by the extremely low results on classes that are presented to the model in very low frequency."

    "#Results of Advanced Model\n",
    "The advanced model has a macro average of 0.23 for precision, which means that when each class is treated equally, this value gives the model's overall performance of precision. This macro average is 0.21 for recall, and 0.21 for f1. All of these values are lower then the macro averages of the baseline model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The micro average is the same as the baseline model, which means that when the classes are given the same weight, the model the precision, recall and f1-score all have a value of 0.95\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common arguments in the dataset, and most common arguments in SRL are Arg0 and Arg1. Arg0 has a high precision, recall and f1-score (0.78, 0.82, 0.80), same for Arg1 (0.72, 0.81, 0.77). There are many instances that the model is trained on which have these Arg0 and Arg1 arguments in the sentence. Therefore, it was expected that these values would be higher then other argument-values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arg2 represents the instrument used in SRL. This is also a very important argument that needs to be loooked into. The precision, recall and f1-score for this ARG2 are: (0.63, 0.58, 0.60). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example in this sentence: From the ap comes this story : [SEP] ap comes this [SEP], the model predicts 'AP' as Arg0 when in fact, the gold states this as 'Arg2'. But in the sentence: [CLS] it seems clear to me that the manhunt for high baath officials in the sunni heartland is being done wrong, or at least in ways that are bad for us standing with local iraqis. and 'seems' is the predicate, the model predicts that 'clear' and 'me' are both ARG2. However, gold labels say that 'clear' is ARG1 and 'me' is ARG2. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the predicate is 'clear', the model predicts that 'me' is ARG2, when it is in fact not an argument (as can be seen in the gold data). When the predicate is 'bad', ARG2 is 'standing'. But again the model predicts that there are 2 ARG2's, which are 'US' and 'standing'\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sentence: this operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region, \"\" the message claimed., where 'bring' is the predicate, the model correctly labels 'region' as ARG2. This could explain that the model learns when a 'to' is presented after the predicate, the following token (but excluding 'the'), is labeled as ARG2. Here, it seems as if the model also learns that only the headword can be labeled as an argument, not 'the'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence: it's not quite as freewheeling an environment as you'd imagine : sergey brin has actually created a mathematical'proof'that the company's self - driven research strategy, which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own, is a good, respectable idea. The predicate is \"'s\". The first few tokens are labeled correctly (It, ', s, not) = ['ARG1', 'V', 'V', 'ARGM-NEG']. The next token 'quite' is then labeled as ARG2, as well as 'freewheeling', 'an', and 'environment'. Again, thre are multiple ARG2's predicted in the sentence when in fact the correct ARG2 is 'you'. This is interesting, since the model might be trained on sentences with this 'as ... as' structure, and learned that when an 'as' is presented, the following token should be an ARG2 (which is the case for 'you'). However, it could be that it detects the first 'as' and directly labels the next token as ARG2, not looking further into the sentence as well as the token 'as' itself. Moreover, here, it does not detect the headword of a constituent, which is a good indication of which token needs to be labeled, and which one does not. This could also be further implemented in future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sentence: the food is mediocre at best. --> the predicate is 'is' and the sentence consists of 3 ARG2's. The model predicts these 3 ARG2's correctly. However, the gold gives ARGM-ADV to 'best', the model does not detect this. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at ARG1, we see that many times, this ARG1 is right before the predicate and is correctly labeled. In the sentence: 4826: and they seem to be posted at fairly regular intervals? The ARG1 in this sentence is correctly labeled to be 'they'. \n"

    "# Comparing the models\n",
    "The overall results of the baseline model evidently show its limitations also on the practical level. Although the model presents a high micro-averaged F1-score of 0.95, indicating that the model performs relatively well across all classes - when considering each prediction equally - this is quickly controverted by its very low macro average scores. Macro-average calculates the metric independently for each class and then takes the average across all classes, treating each class equally regardless of its size or frequency. A quick inspection of individual classes makes it clear that the high aggragated micro scores are mostly the product of the a few higly represented classes, including both the predicate class and the placeholder label. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a considerable variation in precision, recall, and F1-score across labels as some classes have high precision and recall, while others have much lower scores including 0. The model seems to be performing well on frequent and well represented labels while the very infrequent ones do not get at all predicted. Classes like 'ARGM-NEG' (Negative Modifier) and 'ARGM-MOD' (Modal Modifier) have a big range in performance, with F1-scores ranging from 0.33 to 0.91, although they are not the most represented ones. On the other hand, 'ARG1' and 'ARG0' are more frequent and show promising but clearly lower results.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach provides a straightforward starting point, it presents notable limitations. One critical drawback is the model's inability to grasp contextual nuances, limiting its capacity to capture the intricate relationships between predicates and their arguments accurately. Due to the lack of contextual understanding, the model may struggle to disambiguate between different senses of predicates and may misclassify arguments. Moreover, relying on simplistic representations limits the model's generalization capabilities across diverse texts and domains, impacting its performance on unseen data. This can also be proven by the extremely low results on classes that are presented to the model in very low frequency."

    "The similarity in performance between the baseline and advanced models suggests that the baseline approach of representing predicates solely by themselves can be surprisingly effective for well represented and common argument labels. This indicates that for certain datasets, simple representations may suffice to capture the necessary information for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). However, the overall experiment underscores the importance of predicate representation in SRL tasks. While more advanced representations may offer additional contextual information, they do not always guarantee significant improvements over simpler approaches. The fact that the advanced model did not outperform the baseline model indicates that the additional contextual information provided by the previous and following tokens may not be as influential or as sufficient as thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the difference in performance among some classes - as discussed above - between the two models presents extreme interest and should be further explored. What is more,  future work could explore incorporating broader contextual cues, such as expanding on the previous and next tokens representations with including more tokens. In addition to contextual information, exploring the role of syntactic structures, such as dependency parsing or constituency parsing, in predicate representation could offer valuable insights into improving SRL model performance. For example,  detecting the headword of a constituent, could be a good indication of which token needs to be labeled, and which one does not."
