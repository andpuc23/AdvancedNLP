    "### The Approach\n",
    "The argument identification and classification experiment will be carried out with two different approaches both employing the BERT model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the predicate identification is a given in this experiment, the main challenge of this task is to find a solution for\n",
    "representing the relation between each sentence and the predicate under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original PropBank dataset, sentences can host any number of predicates (including none) thus, when a sentence has two or more predicates, the rest of its tokens are bound to express different arguments in relation to each predicate. Consequently, in order for the model to be able to correctly predict and assign argument labels for a sentence, we need to first establish - each time - the predicate under consideration. For example, in the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"John cooked dinner and served dessert to his guests.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "for both predicates \"cooked\" and \"served\", the subject (ARG0) is \"John\", but the object (ARG1) is \"dinner\" for \"cooked\" and \"dessert\" for \"served\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our focus lies in determining an effective representation for the model input allowing for the model to classify the arguments within a sentence relative to a specific predicate. The first step is reduplicating each sentence based on the number of its predicates so each sentence is presented in the dataset each time in relation to a unique predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the process involves structuring the input data in a manner that enables the model to understand the relationships between tokens and the possible argument labels within the context of a specific predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To experiment on the basis of the input representation, we will build both a baseline and an advanced model. In both cases the relation of each sentence and a specific predicate will be encoded into the model's input. "

    "#### The Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "The fucntion of the baseline model is to offer a straightforward approach to the task, serving as a reference point for evaluating the effectiveness of the more advanced model. As such, the baseline will be employing a more simplistic approach to input representation inspired by Shi and Lin (2019):\n",
    "\n",
    "[CLS] Barack Obama went to Paris [SEP] went [SEP] ,\n",
    "\n",
    "in which the predicate information - each time signaling the predicate in question - only consists of the predicate token itself. At the same time, the [CLS] token typically represents the aggregate understanding of the entire sentence, serving as a sentence-level representation and capturing the contextual information necessary for semantic role labeling.\n",
    "The [SEP] token demarcates the boundaries between different segments of the input. In this representation, it separates the sentence from the predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach entails limitations. The mosts obvious one would be the case in which a sentence contains the same predicate twice. In this case only using the predicate itself as the predicate indicator would not allow the model to distinguish between the two different predicates. "
